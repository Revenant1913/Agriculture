                People often perceive things in a different way. What one person involved in organic farming in India believes is correct, trusts in, and practices probably won't suit the prerequisites and objectives of another person who is also into organic farming in India.

This certainly gives traces of what one may expect and where one ought to be beginning from. It is useful to infuse resources into pre-hand research.
